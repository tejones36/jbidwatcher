<h2>Use of <%c_gr%>c<%cend%><%c_bl%>o<%cend%><%c_rd%>l<%cend%>ors in JBidwatcher</h2><br>
This is a relatively simple reference for now.<br>
<ul>
<li><%c_rd%>Red<%cend%><br>
A red auction title means that the item has bids on it, and you are
not the high bidder.  In the 'completed' tab, means an auction that
completed and you did not win.<br>

A red entry (for a brief moment) in the 'Number' (item number) column
means that is the item we are currently updating.<br>

Dates in the 'Current' tab show up briefly red when they are
completed, but haven't had their final update yet.  This should not
happen much, but if a lot of items end at once, it may take a moment
to clear them all out.<br>

Red bid amounts (in the 'Max' column) with a '<%c_rd%>*<%cend%>'
indicate that an error occurred the last time it tried to bid, and
that you can view that error by bringing up the context menu
(right-click, or ctrl-click on Mac OS X), and selecting 'Show Last
Error'.<br>

If the auction is current, and the 'Max' bid is red with parenthesis
around it like '<%c_rd%>($17.07)<%cend%>', then your current bid is
not high enough to be accepted by eBay.  They reject too-low bids,
so JBidwatcher uses this as a warning that your bid is below the
minimum amount eBay will accept.

</li><li><%c_gr%>Green<%cend%><br>
Green auction titles only show up in the 'seller' tab, where it means
that someone has bid on your auction, and (barring cancellations) your
item will sell!<br>

If there is a value in the 'Max' column, and it is green, then you
have a snipe set up for that amount, it is above the current bid
(plus one bid increment, if there are any bids), and it has not
fired yet.  When it fires, the color changes to black, as per below.<br>

A green entry in the 'Number' (item number) column means that the item
was added within the last 5 minutes, or hasn't been updated since it
was loaded.  Whichever happens first, it will update the item number
to black, as usual.

</li><li><%c_bl%>Blue<%cend%><br>
Blue titles are a good sign, in general.  It means that an auction has
bids, and you are current high bidder, and above the reserve.  In
'complete', of course, this means that you have won the item.  The only
caveat, is that private auctions can sometimes skew this under rare
circumstances.  Always check on eBay, to make sure you've won.

</li><li>Black<br>
Black titles simply mean that there are no bids <i>above the reserve,
if any</i> on that particular item.  If there is a non-zero bidcount
in parenthesis in the 'Current' column, but the title is still black,
then none of the bids are above reserve.  This is identical in all the
tabs.<br>

A value (in some currency) in black in the 'Max' column, means you
have bid that amount on the auction, and the amount was submitted to
eBay.  It doesn't mean you have high bid, or that the bid was even
successful.  For that, look for a <%c_bl%>blue<%cend%> or
<%c_rd%>red<%cend%> title.

</li><li><strike>Strikeout</strike><br>
Strikeout through the time display in the upper right of the display
means that for some reason there are problems communicating with the
auction server site.
</li><li><b>Bold</b><br>
Bold on an auction identifier (number) means that there is a
comment associated with that auction.  Right click on the auction and
select 'View Comment' to see the comment.  Using 'View Information'
will give it as well.  If your windowing system supports tooltips, the
comment will also show up in the tooltip for that item.
</li>
<li>Pinned Note <img src="<%res:/icons/note3.gif%>"><br>
This means the same as Bold on an auction identifier, above.  There is
a comment on the auction.
</li>
<li>'B' with speed lines <img src="<%res:/icons/bin_item.gif%>"><br>
This item has Buy It Now enabled.  Items which have the Buy It Now
logo alone, without the white ball, are 'Fixed Price'.  You can only
use B.I.N. to purchase them.  (You should also see '(FP)' in the
current price column.)
</li>
<li>The single-character PayPal logo <img src="<%res:/icons/paypal16x16.gif%>"><br>
This item supports payment via PayPal.
</li>
<li>Camera <img src="<%res:/icons/camera.gif%>"><br>
This means that there is a thumbnail image available.  You can hover
your cursor over the item, and it will show it in a moment, or you can
right-click (Ctrl-Click for MacOSX) and choose 'Show Information' and
it will show the thumbnail along with the item information.
</li>
<li>Red 'R' bar sinister <img src="<%res:/icons/unmet_reserve.gif%>"><br>
Simply means that there is a reserve, and it has not yet been met.
</li>
<li>Blue 'R' in a circle <img src="<%res:/icons/met_reserve.gif%>"><br>
There is a reserve on this item, but the current price is above that
reserve price.
</li>
<li>Winning <img src="<%res:/icons/winning.gif%>"><br>
This means that you are the current high bidder, and above the reserve
if any, on this item.
</li>
<li>Green ball <img src="<%res:/icons/green_ball.gif%>"><br>
This only shows up on your 'selling' page, and it means that your
item has a bid that is above the reserve, if any, and will sell
barring bid cancellations.
</li>
<li>Invalid Item <img src="<%res:/icons/invalid.png%>"><br>
This indicates that JBidwatcher could not successfully read the item from
eBay the last time it tried.  It could be because of a communications
failure, because it's in a section you don't have access to, or because
the item has been deleted from eBay.
</li>
<li>Deleted Item <img src="<%res:/icons/deleted.png%>"><br>
This indicates that JBidwatcher has determined the item has been removed
from eBay.
</li></ul>
